        "\n",
        "ANS:- The NOT NULL constraint is applied to a column to ensure that it cannot contain NULL values. This is important for several reasons:-\n",
        "\n",
        "**1.Data Integrity:-** NOT NULL enforces that a specific piece of information is always provided for each record in the table. This helps maintain the accuracy and completeness of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2.Data Validation:-** It acts as a basic form of data validation, preventing accidental or intentional insertion of incomplete records.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3.Query Optimization:-** Databases can often optimize queries more effectively when they know that a column will always have a value, as this eliminates the need to handle NULL cases during processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4.Referential Integrity:-** In cases where a column is used as a foreign key to link to another table, NOT NULL helps maintain the integrity of relationships between tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "No, a primary key cannot contain NULL values. This is a fundamental rule of relational databases. Here's why:-\n",
        "\n",
        "**1.Unique Identification:-** The primary key's role is to uniquely identify each record in a table. If a primary key column allowed NULL values, it would be impossible to distinguish between records with NULL in the primary key column.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2.Referential Integrity:-** Primary keys are often referenced by foreign keys in other tables to establish relationships. A NULL value in a primary key would make it impossible for foreign keys to reliably link to the corresponding record.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3.Data Consistency:-** Allowing NULL values in a primary key would introduce ambiguity and inconsistencies into the database structure, undermining its reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Justification**\n",
        "\n",
        "The combination of uniqueness and non-nullability in a primary key is essential for maintaining data integrity and ensuring the proper functioning of a relational database. If a primary key could be NULL, it would break these fundamental principles:-\n",
        "\n",
        "**1.Uniqueness:-** NULL values are not considered unique. If a primary key could be NULL, we could have multiple records with NULL in the primary key column, violating the uniqueness constraint.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2.Identification:-** NULL essentially means \"unknown\" or \"no value.\" If a primary key could be NULL, it wouldn't be able to reliably identify specific records.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, to enforce these principles, primary keys are inherently defined as NOT NULL."

        "\n",
        "**3.Transaction Rollback (if applicable):-** If the operation was part of a larger transaction, the entire transaction might be rolled back, meaning all changes made within the transaction will be undone. This ensures that the database remains consistent even if one part of the transaction fails.\n",
